Agent, I think you should know this before proceeding further:

- Have you ever heard of 'metadata'? Instagram apparently tracks you by storing the metadata from the images you upload. Beware freshers, metadata may hold more information than you think!

- Broken access control is a security problem in websites and apps where someone can get into parts of the system they shouldn't be able to access. This can occur if the app doesn't properly check a user's permission before letting them perform an action, like changing a URL to access someone else's file.
